As can be seen in this example of the tagger, the frame is tagged by choosing the tail base, neck base and nose points.
Each frame that is being tagged is shown together with 5 frames before and 5 frames after in order to help the person who is tagging make 
the most accurate tag. In addition, the tagger allows changing the brightness of the frame for more accurate results.
